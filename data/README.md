# Dataset Instructions

## Full Dataset

Full dataset (`accepted_2007_to_2018.csv`) must be downloaded from Kaggle:
- Visit: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club
- Download the `accepted_2007_to_2018.csv` file
- Place the full CSV in a local folder when running notebooks
- **Do NOT upload the full CSV to GitHub** (too large)

## Sample Dataset

A small sample is included in `data/sample/` for quick reproduction.
- Use `accepted_sample_5pct.csv` to test your code locally
- This is useful for debugging before running on the full dataset
